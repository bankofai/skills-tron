## What is a Skill?

A **Skill** is a document containing detailed instructions that teaches AI agents how to accomplish specific tasks.

**Analogy**: Like providing an "operation manual" to AI, telling it how to use tools to get work done.

```
User: "Help me swap USDT for TRX"
  ↓
AI Agent reads SunSwap Skill
  ↓
AI Agent follows SKILL.md instructions
  ↓
Calls mcp-server-tron tools
  ↓
Completes DEX trade
```

## Quick Start

### 1. Browse Available Skills

Currently available:
- **sunswap/** - SunSwap DEX trading skill for TRON token swaps
- **8004-skill/** - 8004 Trustless Agents (TRC-8004 / BSC implementation)
- **x402-payment/** - Enables agent payments on TRON network (x402 protocol)
- **x402-payment-demo/** - Demo of x402 payment protocol

### 2. Use a Skill

Tell your AI Agent:
```
Please read sunswap/SKILL.md and help me check how much TRX I can get for 100 USDT
```

The AI Agent will:
1. Read SKILL.md
2. Call appropriate tools following instructions
3. Return results

## How to Use Skills

### Compatible AI Agents

These Skills can be used with various AI agent platforms that support MCP (Model Context Protocol), including:
- **ClawdCode** - AI coding assistant
- **OpenCode** - Open-source AI development environment
- **OpenClaw** - AI agent framework
- And other MCP-compatible AI agents

### Installation Example (Using OpenClaw)

1. ✅ Install AI Agent (e.g., OpenClaw)
2. ✅ Install **OpenClaw Extension** 
   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bankofai/openclaw-extension/refs/heads/main/install.sh | bash
   ```

That's it! The installer will set up everything you need.

### For Other AI Agent Platforms

If you're using other MCP-compatible AI agents (ClawdCode, OpenCode, etc.):

1. ✅ Install your AI Agent
2. ✅ Configure MCP servers manually (see respective MCP server documentation)
3. ✅ Clone this Skills repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/bankofai/skills.git
   ```
4. ✅ Point your AI agent to the Skills directory or reference specific SKILL.md files when needed

## FAQ

### Q: Do skills need separate installation?

**A**: ❌ No. Skills are just documents that AI agents read directly.

### Q: What's the difference between Skills and MCP Servers?

**A**: 
- **Skill** = Instruction document (teaches AI how to do something)
- **MCP Server** = Tool service (provides actual capabilities)

Skills tell AI how to use MCP Server tools.

### Q: How do I know what dependencies a skill needs?

**A**: Check the YAML frontmatter in SKILL.md:
```yaml
dependencies:
  - mcp-server-tron
```

### Q: What if AI Agent can't find the skill?

**A**: Tell it explicitly:
```
Please read sunswap/SKILL.md
```

### Q: Can I modify skills?

**A**: ✅ Yes! Edit SKILL.md directly, AI Agent will read the latest version.
